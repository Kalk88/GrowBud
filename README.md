# GrowBud

## Run locally
### Setup
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
In the project root folder run ```docker-compose up --build```, to build and spin up application containers. Run ```docker-compose down``` to stop them. The build flag is only necessary the first time, check out the [docker-compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for more details.
